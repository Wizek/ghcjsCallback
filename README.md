# ghcjsCallback

This project demonstrates how to do a callback from javascript to haskell in ghcjs.  To build the project you need to have a recent version of ghcjs.

To see it in action.... 

First, compile Main.hs using ghcjs:

    ghcjs Main.hs

then, to run the resulting javascript under node: 

    node Main.jsexe/all.js

You are currently looking at the nodejs branch.  To view code that runs in the browser, switch to the master branch.
